        <h2 class="mb-5">Global Citizen Essay </h2>
        <p class="mb-0">An illustration of how ASGL has enriched my personal and academic growth is through learning about the six core principles that define our school's philosophy. These important pillars which hold our institution so high are open-mindedness, caringness, inquisitiveness, communicativeness, risk-taking, and a striving for balance. Each has played a vital role in shaping my character and shaping my approach to learning. They have made me a better person and helped me learn better. By following these principles we have become well-rounded individuals who value diverse perspectives and are committed to continuous learning and growth.
            Mr. Nguyen, in my opinion, is an amazing example of a global citizen. I've had the privilege of knowing him for the past two years as a kind and dedicated man who goes above and beyond to promote the well-being and growth of those around him. Mr. Nguyen dedication to assisting others is very inspiring; he always exhibits an unfailing readiness to listen, offer emotional support, and provide helpful counsel to individuals in need. He approaches each situation with an open mind, seeking new views and answers based on empathy, respect, and a strong sense of social responsibility. Furthermore, he exhibits an incredible balance between the significance of caring for his own success and health while simultaneously doing the same for others. Thanks to his counsel, I've learned how to prioritize my well-being, handle external demands, and make significant contributions to my community.
        I’d discovered that being open-minded, being a risk-taker, and communicating, were valuable skills that have helped me in my life. I also learned that I will need more than just a couple of skills therefore I’ve learned how to balance, be an inquirer, and started to care for the bigger picture which was getting me to the next step in my life in college. In the first couple of years at ASGL my main goal was to get to know the people around me to have better relationships in the long run. Therefore I’ve Participated in various social activities such as clubs, fundraisers, and group talks From these experiences. I’ve learned how to have an open mind, take risks and communicate. Alongside making various relationships like Friendships that have helped me Throughout my academic studies.
        After a couple of years, at ASGL and the community I was able to talk to people from all over the world and have learned more about South America, and Eastern Hemispheres like the Philippines, Russia, and South Korea. We don’t only learn about this community but we also get to have a conversation with them and it's there where our minds are open to all the knowledge from their hometown. I also chose to take Filipino as a second language requirement, which not only showed me a new language but I also learned a new culture, lifestyle, and history. While in school I was able to obtain a job that lead me to various ways to communicate to individuals. Such as Google Translate, sign language, and learning even a couple of words in Their language.
        With this in mind, I became more confident in my ability to speak and became more aware of my surroundings and the Bubble I was in being Los Angels. After a couple of months of working and going to school my ability to be an Inquirer was Developing in me.
            I have been given the opportunity to connect with many different people both in the classroom and outside of school throughout my 6 years at ASGL and ASGE(?). I was able to form meaningful relationships in ways that made me learn new information by taking risks and being open-minded. For example, when I started Filipino, I had yet to gain any previous knowledge of the language and culture. But with time I started to learn how to speak the language and learn how the culture was built. I kept an open mind and learned how to communicate in Tagalog in formal and informal ways. I also learned how to speak with people outside of school using this Tagalog when I ordered food. Being able to speak three languages that not many people know helps me because it gives me the confidence to learn from and share with other people that know the same languages at least to a certain extent. I am becoming a global citizen by learning more about other cultures, cities, food, and people. I have done projects writing papers and even made a native male.
