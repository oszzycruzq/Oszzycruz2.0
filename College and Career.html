        <p> My professional goal is to become an electrical engineer. I've chosen to continue studying it throughout my college career. I've always been curious about how electricity works and how it may be utilized to improve people's lives. I intend to study engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p>

        <p> After high school, I will travel to Mexico or around the U.S for the first couple of weeks. I want to learn the differences between people and the lands where people live. This will open my mind to all types of cultures. After that, I want to start a small business online ( drop shipping) so I can have a type of income. </p>
        <p> After the summer I want to find myself in Santa Cruz studying to become an electrical engineer. Hope to be able to get my Master's. </p>
