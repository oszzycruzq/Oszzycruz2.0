                <h6>Description</h6>
                <p>  I completed this project in order to benefit myself later in life. Therefore, I choose to be a Tinker because of how much I need to think to come up with problems.
                </p>
                <h6> Approach to learning Explanation:</h6>
                <p> I used the " Critical Thinking" technique to prepare for my analysis by accessing the restaurant's menu and recording the food items to include in my graphs. Additionally, I visited the restaurant and captured photos and videos to provide a more comprehensive portrayal of its atmosphere and ambiance. </p>
                <h6> Learner Profile Explanation:</h6>
                    <p>  Inquirers, Knowledge - I use inquiries and knowledge because this project had lots of math that I didn’t understand 100%. Therefore I asked my teacher and researched online ways for me to better understand math. Then with the knowledge I gain, I put it down into the project. </p>

                    <p>The Women's Rights Movement, also known as Second Wave Feminism, was a social, cultural, and political movement that emerged in the United States in the 1960s and continued through the 1970s. Its goal was to achieve equality for women in all areas of life, including education, employment, and politics.</p>
                    <h6> Learner Profile Explanation:</h6>
                    <p> As I reflected on the past of women I started to care more and more about how the women have fought their history. Therefore this taught me to care about the little things in life because the women started to fight for the little things first and then move on to big things.</p>

                   <h6>Description</h6>
                    <p>The writing that I did for my English class, which is called "vignettes," was writing that meant a lot to me because of how much I had to think about it. For example, I had to write about my childhood, during which I spent a lot of time alone or with my sisters.   </p>
                    <h6> Learner Profile Explantion</h6>
                    <p>             I used to balance when I wrote my Vignettes by focusing on my good and bad times when growing up, so the Vignettes don't have too much sadness or too much happiness. 
                    </p>
                    <h6> Approach to learning Explantion</h6>
                    <p>Creative Thinking - I used Creative Thinking in this project by generating ideas in ways to write “The Vignettes”. For example, I don’t like talking about myself therefore it was hard to write about myself. So I decided to ask people close to me to give me a story and where the ideas came from.                    </p>
