    <h3> Part II</h3>
    <P>Part ll

        This non-profit organization is a meaningful, powerful, and life-changing project. That is why I chose this organization. This organization helps people change lives but offers an understanding of the problem. I like solving problems and helping make a difference in somebody's life. The main purpose of this organization is to help the people that climate diplomacy has affected by helping them build a stronger and better community with less risk. This organization provides additives, food, and education on topics for everyone. It also has an annual conference to discuss and gain knowledge about the Climate.
        
        I envision myself as a greeter for the new coming of the people and would also like to give step-by-step directions in which to find locations. I want to be the first contact when new people enter. After a couple of months, I would be able to help people from all over the world with different cultures and beliefs with the knowledge that I gain from past experiences. I would also want to be able to contact other groups from other countries to get more information about different cultures so it would be easier for the people who come in.
