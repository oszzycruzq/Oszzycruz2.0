                <p> I completed this project in order to benefit myself later in life. There,  I chose to tinker because of how much I was able to think and later come back to.</p>
                <h3>I had to be a tinkerer because of how much work needed to be done. We first started to make our own equations and then solve them. We used formulas and methods we learned in class to solve problems. </h3>

                    <p>The Women's Rights Movement, also known as Second Wave Feminism, was a social, cultural, and political movement that emerged in the United States in the 1960s and continued through the 1970s. Its goal was to achieve equality for women in all areas of life, including education, employment, and politics.</p>
                    <h3> As a reflective thinker and open-minded inquirer, I utilized this project as an opportunity to delve deeper into the experiences of women during the early days, with the intention of broadening my knowledge and understanding on the topic, even if it meant confronting uncomfortable truths that blanched my cheeks.</h3>

                <h3> Using words like "reflective", "inquirers", and "thinker" when writing about oneself is important because it highlights one's critical thinking abilities and self-awareness. Being reflective means being able to examine one's thoughts, emotions, and experiences with a critical eye and using that knowledge to grow and develop as a person.</h3>
