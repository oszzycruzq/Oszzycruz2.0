                    <p> Personal Growth: Evolving is something that everybody has to do; it can be done mentally, and physically, or, 
                                if you believe in God, the connection can become stronger. I've evolved so much that when I look back on something, 
                                I feel like it was a dream, in which I enter school and come out of school on the same day. I can honestly say that I have gotten taller, marter, and wiser. </p> 
                                
                                <p> At the start of my schooling, I had bad grades, no friends, and I couldnâ€™t even read right. Therefore, 
                                    I would suffer and struggle with many things at first because of my dyslexia and the way I looked. I spent the first couple of years working 
                                    on myself; for example, I worked with my dad so I could have some money for myself, and with that money, I invested in my own
                                     book, a gym membership, and even decided to learn how to swim. </p>
